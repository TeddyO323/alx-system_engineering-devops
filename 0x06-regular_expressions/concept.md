# Regular Expression

<p>A regular expression, commonly called a &ldquo;regexp&rdquo;, is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. &nbsp;It&nbsp;is&nbsp;mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching (i.e. it operates&nbsp;like&nbsp;a&nbsp;&ldquo;find and replace&rdquo; command). While it is a very powerful tool, it is also very dangerous because of its complexity.</p>

<p>One thing you have to be careful with is that different languages use different regexp engines. That&nbsp;means&nbsp;that&nbsp;a regexp in Python, for&nbsp;example,&nbsp;will be interpreted differently&nbsp;in Javascript:</p>

<p>Regular expressions are everywhere and software engineers, no&nbsp;matter their positions, will have to use them during their careers. System administrators and DevOps are the ones using them the most because&nbsp;they are very handy for log parsing.</p>
